# Comments

\[Click Comments + Inbox\] It’s basically an inbuilt commenting system. It has lots of capabilities \[Global Actions\] from approving to moderation. You have a lot of settings \[comment + settings\] available for commenting as well, from enabling ‘Site Wide’ comments, to disabling them. URL translations, security captchas, moderation rules, notification rules, so you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to your comments so you can attach comments to anything e.g. pages, blog entries, etc except the Content Store.
