# Content Response Formats

When you are in your site \(not in the admin\) there are also pretty cool things you can do. We created what we call _print renders_. You can now come in and say, I want to view my page as print. You just need to add &lt;.print&gt; to the page URL and hit enter. And you will see that it changes the whole format to the print version. You have complete control of this layout as well. By convention, you just have the same layout called underscore print. You can create one called underscore pdf as well or add “.pdf” to URL, and you'll see that it’ll produce a pdf output of your page as you designed it. You can also produce a word document by adding &lt;.doc&gt; to the URL of the page.
