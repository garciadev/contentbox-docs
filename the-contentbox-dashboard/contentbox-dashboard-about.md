# About

Our about page is very useful. Apart from your build information, it contains keyboard shortcuts! ContentBox has a lot of keyboard shortcuts available for you and, once they are memorized you can very easily navigate using them. Also, for you module developers we also have an API based on a jquery javascript library. And you can very easily do data biding for your own shortcuts so if you want to offer your own keyboard shortcuts itâ€™s very easy.
