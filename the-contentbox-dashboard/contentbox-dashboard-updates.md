  Ortus Solutions.

# Updates

Check for updates: We have a Stable Channel that can check against new ContentBox releases. We also have a Bleeding Edge Release: all our releases will go in our release cycle so all our releases will be in the bleeding edge channel 1 or 2 weeks before actually making it to a stable channel.

#### Download Updates:

If you are upgrading from an old version of ContentBox, or you are an Ortus Solutions support client, we have the capability to give you an URL for specific patches.

#### Upload Updates:

If you donâ€™t have internet access you can upload the patch and it will be delivered through your ContentBox installation. Options 2 and 3 are great avenues for those companies and individuals that have support contracts or other special project arrangements with Ortus Solutions.
