# The Blog

The Blog \[Content dropdown menu + blog\], it basically reuses almost the same things. Actually, under the hood, you can say we have an ORM object model that you can very easily extend and create custom content types, so, entries actually are just another custom content type based on a custom content object that we provide in ContentBox. You have the same capabilities \[Global Actions\] except there is no hierarchy but the rest itâ€™s the same as if you were writing a normal page except these are based on blogs.
