# Administrator

Below is a listing of all the major updates in the administration modules.

## Admin UI

The administration module sports a completely re-designed responsive UI. Our goal was to think mobile first and build from there. So you will see tons of great additions for working on mobile devices, new editors, new fullscreen mdoes and much much more. Below is a nice image gallery of all the changes in the administration module. Please note that every single screen has changed.

## Markdown Native Support

ContentBox now sports native Markdown support for writing all content objects. You can even choose markdown on a per-user level as your preferred writing style.

## New Code Editor

We have included a new code editor that supports HTML and Markdown natively. This will allow developers or editors to write in native markup and have all the integrations into ContentBox. It also sports realtime previews and side-by-side editing in full screen. Your editing experience is about to get a whole lot better now.

## Editor Escaping Markup Translations

You can now use the `<escape></escape>` syntax in any content editor to escape ContentBox translations for settings, markdown, etc.
